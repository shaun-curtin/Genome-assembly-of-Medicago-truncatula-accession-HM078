The Medicago truncatula accession HM078 genome assembly was generated to investigate disease resistance to srping black stem and leaf spot (SBS) disease. 

The document HM078_genome_assembly_associated_code.html contains the code we ran to produce the assembly and conduct comparative genomics analysis of QTL regions. 

The document SyRI_A17_vs_HM78_whole-genome_alignment.Chr4.vcf.gz contains the VCF file of chromosome 4 for SBS-susceptible accession A17 vs SBS-resistant accession HM078. This chromosome contains QTL regions rnpm1 and rnpm2.
