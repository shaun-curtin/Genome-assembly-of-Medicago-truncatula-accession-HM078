The Medicago truncatula accession HM078 genome assembly was generated to investigate disease resistance to srping black stem and leaf spot (SBS) disease. 

The document HM078_genome_assembly_associated_code.html contains the code we ran to produce the assembly and conduct comparative genomics analysis of QTL regions. 

The document SyRI_A17_vs_HM78_whole-genome_alignment.Chr1-4.vcf.gz contains the VCF file of chromosomes 1 - 4 for SBS-susceptible accession A17 vs SBS-resistant accession HM078. 

The document SyRI_A17_vs_HM78_whole-genome_alignment.Chr5-8.vcf.gz contains the VCF file of chromosomes 5 - 8 for SBS-susceptible accession A17 vs SBS-resistant accession HM078.
